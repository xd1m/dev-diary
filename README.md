# ğŸ’» My Dev Diary

## ğŸ‘‹ Beginning

Hello all ! My name is **`Hasan Alqadri`**, and I'm a passionate **Software Engineer**. I specialize in **quality assurance**, **Python programming**, and **data engineering**. I hold certifications in **QA Assurance** and **Python**, and I collaborate with **Chinese tech companies** on large-scale data projects.

### **My current work involves:**

- Collecting and processing **big data**

- Supporting **AI training pipelines**
- Performing **transcription tasks** for machine learning datasets

### What I Learned from the *Good Developer Mindset* Article

Reading the *Good Developer Mindset* article helped reinforce these key points:

- **Learning is continuous** â€” even experienced developers need to stay updated.
- **Asking for help is a strength**, not a weakness.
- **Testing early and often** prevents major setbacks.
- **Reading documentation** is crucial for efficiency and self-sufficiency.

>**(These insights remind me to stay humble, stay curious, and never stop improving my skills)**

### What I Learned from the *Terminal Command Cheat Sheet*

Using the terminal effectively can save time and improve my workflow. I practiced the following commands:

- `pwd` â€“ shows the current directory
- `ls` â€“ lists files and folders
- `cd` â€“ changes directories
- `mkdir` â€“ creates a new folder
- `touch` â€“ creates a new file
- `git add .` â€“ stages all changes
- `git commit -m "message"` â€“ commits changes
- `git push origin main` â€“ pushes changes to GitHub

**Hereâ€™s a screenshot of the terminal while I was using these commands:**
